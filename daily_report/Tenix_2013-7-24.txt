I watch news yesterday, an earthquake was happened in China
again.
It has left hundreds of death and thousands injured.

The earthquake hit near the city of Dingxi in Gansu province.
Residents described it shook windows and swang lights at
the start, but little panic.

It knocked down power lines and damaged many houses
in the end.
The rescue team from the People's Armed Police were on their
way to the affected area, but progress was being slowed
by mud and rock slides.
I hope they can get there as soon as possible and all
people can be safe.
