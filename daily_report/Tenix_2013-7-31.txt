The bomber who I mentioned yesterday suffered arm 
injuries in the blast, but there were no other
casualties, according to the news.

Some media had instead expressed support for him,
depicting him as a victim, not a terrorist.
Witnesss said that him had told passersby to keep 
distance with him before detonating the bomb.

He used this way to draw people's attention for his
complaint which indeed let people feel very sad.
That's all. Thanks.
