I tried to download the source code of android when I at the beginning of the work, today.
But, I don't know where to download.
Then, Allan helped me download a version of Mango 3G platform from servers. 

In the next few days, I will use them to build up an image.
At 10:00, I started the class until about 3:40.

The component of the notebook, a little history of the company 
and its human resources were introduced.

I went back to the office after the class and did a smoke test with the new image.
There was one error with the HDMI test, the sound can't come out from the HDMI monitor.

That's all. Thanks.
