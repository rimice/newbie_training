Today, I went to class as soon as I had today's work.
I had two classes in the morning, there were also two in the afternoon.

In class, I learned something about comprehensive Free Trade Zone.

These areas are special designed area under the customs supervision and control.
It get rid of the barriers, allowing advantage of the human cost of Kunshan into full use.

Besides, I learned how to send and receive a mail and some points which should be noticed.
For example, we should not send novels, music, and other content that has nothing to do with the job.
Pay attention to the format of the mail, to specification and so on.

That's all.Thanks.
