Today I was caught in the rain, when I went out.
It did rain pretty heavily,today. 
More than half of my clothes were all wet though I wear a raincoat,
when I went to the company. My shoes even were wet, too.

But,come what may, we must finish the work.
Today, I tried to write a linked list programming, that's a typical programming which is a student management system 
uses linked list for data creating, inserting, deleting, and display the result.

Linked lists is a important data structure in data structure, which includes stack,
queue and linear list.

It's hard to deal linked lists with C pointer which embodies a significant trait of
C programming language.

This is also its charm.
That's all.Thanks.
