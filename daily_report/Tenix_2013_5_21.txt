Today was a bit special day.
My brother-in-law came to see me, we ate lunch together in the company's dinning room.
He also brought a bottle of water to me, just I was thirsty, too.
We talked for a while. He is one of the venders of the Wistron, at least ten years.
He talked about the Wistron some parters, some of the cooperation.
For example,Wistron plans to cooperrate with Apple, to product their electronic devices.
A global meeting was going to be in the afternoon.
I had to admit that Wistron is a big complay.

The coincidence, in the afternoon, our department also had a meeting, the weekly meeting.
This was my first time to attend. 
We went in to a small conference room on the second floor.
We discussed the mango some problems such as fastboot, audio, HDCPkey, wifi and the other doro. 
Meeting didn't last long, very concise.

These were two things happend today.
That's all. Thanks.
