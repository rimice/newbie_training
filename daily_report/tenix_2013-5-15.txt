I have been in the Wistron for work two days, and it is my first daily report. I hope I can make a good performance to write this.

In this moring, Willian help me to install the linux of ubuntu,meanwhile I read the book which has been in the office. 

Many white cleaned tables with computers on them in the office, making a feeling to have a good work atmosphere.

But,the installation process is not smooth because it depend on the correctness of the installation files. 

After several attempts, we happy to see that this can be run at last. I enter into the OS and simply apply under this new environment.

This is the environment which I have to use for a long time. It is very mysterious and charming to attact me. 

Later,Willian and director help me to install ntlmap services as well as some of other settings on the system let my computer surfing the Internet and I have registered on the github website. 

I will do my best in the next work ,too. All of you are very generous. Thanks all of you very much. 

That's all. Thanks.
