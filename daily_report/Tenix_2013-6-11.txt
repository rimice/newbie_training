Tomorrow is Duanwu Festival which is celebrated on the fifth day of
the fifth month according to the Chinese Calendar.

The holiday starts from June 10 to 12, 2013. But, we are not.
We had to work yesterday and today, tomorrow we will have the holiday.
So, few cars were on my way to work over the past two days.

The festival has a long history.
For thousands of years, it has been marked by eating zongzi
and racing dragon boats.

It is originated to commemorate the famous Chinese poet Qu Yuan who
drowned himself by attaching a heavy stone to his chest and jumping
into a river.

so, people race dragon boats for attempting to rescue he, throw zongzi
into river ,they believe, that would prevent the fishes from eating his body.

I wish I can have a wonderful holiday.
That's all. Thanks.
