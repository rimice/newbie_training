Today was a new day, new week too.The weather also turned good,
and swepted away a few days of overcast sky.
I went to work as usual,but not so stuck on the road.
I began a new day in the company.

In the moring, I tested my first linux driver training.
Code compilation had passed, I also thought there was no problem.
but, the compiled suffix file of ko cannot be loaded into the kernel.
The kernel prompt was that inserting './helloworld.ko' was error.
I searched the problem in the google, and accorded to the instruction one of them. The version of the kernel was caused by
that problem. 
The linux kernel is really very big and detailed.

I searched and tested the git instructions so to modify the uploading of name and email in the afternoon. Then I uploaded the code. 
Later, I studied book about linux driver.

That's all. Thanks.
