I tidied my room last weekend.
Almost all of the place has been swept clean.
I don't like anyone else to arrange my room because they
don't know where I usually put my stuff. 

Today is Monday. And a new week begin.
In this week, I plan to continue doing my weekly program.
When I immersed in the program, I felt very happy.

In the afternoon, I did a smoke test. William helped me to burn 
the HDMI key.
The HDMI monitor will not be displayed if there is no key.
That's all. Thanks
