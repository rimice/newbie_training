Today, I update the code of linux driver training ex02, which my director had point out my mistakes about code style.

This is really a problem we should pay attention to.
In fact, if developing a strict code style, for sufficient error handing, most of the problems could have been avoided.

I remembered the days when I just into the company, my director had told me that
a clean and compact code is a work of art, too.

That's right, whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing well.
In addition, we should be carefully in everything we do.

A good code is clear, rigorous thinking, I think.
I decide to do it well, I'll try my best to do.
That's all. Thanks.
