Today, I think about a question about that an earthquake may 
take place anywhere on the earth and its consequences is
too terrible to imagine.

So can we do something to protect ourselves against the earthquakes.
In the earthquake belts, we should build special houses to 
resist earthquake shocks and protect ourselves.
Find a secure location to wait out the quake, such as under a heavy
table, or a corner between in two walls.

But anyway, I still hope that it will never happen earthquakes.
That's all. Thanks.
