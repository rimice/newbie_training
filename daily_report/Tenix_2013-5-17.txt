Today was a raniy day, the temperature was appropriate, very comfortable.

So I also began to a day of learning. In moring, I was to familar with git and other instruction as a beginning.
I searched on Google about some related documents. Learning is the accumulation little by little.

Accumulation is very important.

Then, I also found some documents in the Baidu document libray. But it didn't worked on my firefox browser in the ubuntu.
The browser prompted me that it lack a plugin of Adobe flash. It maked my head  biger.
I tried to make it normal, according to the last was ok.

In the afternon, I downloaded a latest kernel on the official linux web site to write one of the most basic linux kernel driver.
May be my configuration was not correct, the code had writted failed to compile.

After that, I used the ubuntu already existed kernel to compile and it successful, then today.

That's all. Thanks.
