It was raining, when I went to work today.
The weather was not good,and may rain at night,too.
Many people went in the rain and got wet, because they don't carry an umbrella.
They might wish it could stop raining, as soon as possible.

But I love rainy day although it's wet outside.
As a good song sailor in my memory, "He said the storm, in this wind and rain what kind of pain, do not ask why, wipe away tears,at least we still have dreams".

Maybe everyone has dreams, whether or not we ever talk about them,or write them down.
And yet what are dreams, and what is my.
Without dreams, we have no future.

Dream what you want to dream. Be what you want to be.
Have the faith to do more efforts, you dream will translate into 
Reality.

That's all. Thanks.
