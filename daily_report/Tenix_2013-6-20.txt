Today, the temperature dropped a little. 
A few days ago, the weather suddenly turned hot.
Summer is coming, the brightly and strong sunshine will shine down 
on the earth.

As the greenhouse effect, it is becoming more and more hot in summer.
In today's class, the instructor taught us the CSSR management system including the issue
of the environment and health.

Factory have polluted our environment.
It is a creditable goal to save the environment from pollution, but closing down all factories and industries is not a good idea.

So, today we learned the management system in order to make sure all activities accord with the local environment, health and safety requirements.

That's all. Thanks.
