Today, I had almost all day class about the training courses of new employees.
We started the class on the first floor of the fifth factory about 9:30 in the morning and 
stayed until about 4:30.

I walked around and chat with other colleagues in the factory zone after lunch, at noon.
However, I was surprised that the food here is very bad. 

It has almost no flavor and no variety. 
I would have thought that the worst food in the world is in the university canteen.
May be it is now in the factory.

After class, I tried to write my delay function in the kernel, which can be calculated.

That's all. Thanks.
