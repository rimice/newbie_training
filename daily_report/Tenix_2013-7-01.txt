It was a good weather today, also a new week.
But there were not many people go to the company to work as usually.
Even the lunch time, the dining room in the RD building also didn't open.
We went to eat lunch at the factory.
I ate a bowl of noodles there.

It was the beginning of an inventory of the company, though 
I was not very clear about it.

In today's work, I read the GPIO document which was in the kernel.
I learned something about its definitions, rules and so on.
But, I don't know how to use it.
In the few days, I will try to write a GPIO Linux driver.
That's all. Thanks.
