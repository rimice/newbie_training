The sunshine was on my face ,when I went to work.
In this time, I knew that it would very hot today.

In the morning, I did a smoke test.
One error in this test, it had no sound from HDMI monitor.
This is the problem that has always been.

In the afternoon, my director told albert and me something updated about
the smoke test.
Something like the regression test which to test the NVRAM if 
it lost data after flashing the image.
Another to test the device was that if it auto reboot in META mode.
It has no error if it doesn't reboot.

Ablet and I retest it again before we leave work.
That's all. Thanks.
