The temperature is up again today.
I believe that many people complain about the weather 
is too hot in summer.

I heard that many people like to go swimming in the
open water like lakes ,rivers and the sea 
during the current hot weather.

I also think that we can get in touch with nature and free 
ourselves compared with the constraints of indoor swimming 
pools.
It will be a wonderful time to explore in the open water.
That's all. Thanks.
