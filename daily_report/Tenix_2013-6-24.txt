It is a new week. 
I feel time goes so fast, faster than ever before.

Today, I also had a new class for new employees training.
In the morning, the instructor told us some proper nouns used in the factory, such as
QA, FAE, PMC, PE and so on.

The factory's production is too complicated to have many different proper nouns.
If there is a problem in the production, what shall we do ? 
It was learned in the afternoon which is called problem handing process.

It makes a provision for handing problems and allows the process to continue or
retry once these problems are taken care of.

That's all. Thanks.
