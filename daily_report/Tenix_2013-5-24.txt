Writing the report these days, on the one hand ,to prctice my English ,
on the another hand ,I also found my shortage.
For an example,I often use some words which are not very appropriate.
Today, my charge upload some english materials and told me about them.
I also know learning is rely on my own, only my own effort that can improve my English.

I Will study hard at English.
Read more english magazine,listen to the radio. pay more attention on some common usage,
as far as possible to avoid some small mistakes.

Learning English, not a few days can be learnd. There is no shortcut on learn english,
only under the hard study and accumulation, moreover I shoud also practice my writing 
skills. 
It is very important to avoid writing in Chinese way and using the chinese grammar.

In this way, I believe I can gradully improve my English.
That's all. Thanks.
