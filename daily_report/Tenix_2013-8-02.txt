The bomb attack will bring great harm and 
influence to those victims and their family.

Its devastating effects urge people to think 
about the meaning of life and the value of peace.

I think the word peace is the most important
although we still have some conflicts or even
local wars in some places.
Peace can bring happiness to people and it is 
more important than any other things.
That's all. Thanks.
