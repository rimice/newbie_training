Today, I have started the training courses of new employees.

It is a good way to understand and feel the value of the company culture.
I also felt the instructor's enthusiasm deeply ,in class.

She introduced herself first and said it is not where you come from but what you do while 
in school and graduation ,that is really matters.

She mainly talked about the following a week about the main content of the training courses
and note that we must pay more attention to instructor when we have a lesson, especially
to interact with the instructor.

I also saw many new employees, but I didn't awared so many. 

That's all. thanks.
