It is 17th of July today, strong winds are still
lashing coastal areas in China where more than 300000 
people have been left their homes as typhoon Soulik moves inland.

It is reported that flights and train services were cancelled and 
fishing boats called back in some dangerous areas and 
three people have died after typhoon hit china's Guangdong province.

According to the report, the typhoon which has already killed 
two other people in Taiwan,
forced many people to flee their homes.

It is common that during the summer in parts of East Asia,
where the warm moist air and low pressure conditions
enable the typhoon to form.
That all. Thanks.
