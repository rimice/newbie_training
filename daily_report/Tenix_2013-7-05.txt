Perhaps the hot weather made me could not sleep after I drank a cup of
coffee yesterday.
I think that I will not drink coffee in the summer night,
although it is very delicious.

Today, I tried the GPIO functions which was defined by MTK to get the value
of GPIO.
First, I read the schematic diagram carefully to find a GPIO pin which can be test.
 
I chose the pin of front camera and WIFI for my test.
The pin of front camera will turn to zero if I open the front camera ,as the same time
the value of WIFI pin should not change.

I burned the program to Mango kernel to verify the value I get from the
GPIO,and that indeed is true.

To this, I also felt very happy.
That's all. Thanks.
