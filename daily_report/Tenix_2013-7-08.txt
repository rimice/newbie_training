I had a wonderful weekend, last week.
I went to watch movie with my brother and friends and haver a dinner.

The film was about a blind detective portrayed by Andy Lau helped a
policewoman to find her lost friend when she was a child.

This was Andy lau's second movie this year.
I like it,although I thought that the movie was unrealistic and dark.

Because,I felt the film represented our hopes, fears and happiness
which is the most emotion of people, in the reality.

A movie is a microcosm of life ,no matter it is true or not and that 
is also the point attracts people. 
That's all. Thanks.
