Today, I continued to write misc driver. I tried to add a ioctl function and simplified 
the code.

It is not difficult ,since a few days ago study. But, the kernel has still a
lot of functions. It's certainly worth to effort. It's so mysterious.

In the afternoon, my director told me to have a somke test. The image is from Taibei.
As soon as I listened to this, I feeled a bit excited.     
I also want to try it, if there are any different.

Willian helped me to download the image from server. 
As my expected, this time, I can transfer files with my mobile phone. 
I feel very happy. That really surprised me. I had tried many times but could not wrok,
in the previous version.
Product is to be done more and more perfect.

That's all. Thanks.
