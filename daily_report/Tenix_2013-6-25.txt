The weather of today is very cool. The sky had been full of clouds, in the evening.
It rained heavily.

Today, I have learned some theory such as 80/20 rule. It is very interesting and many phenomena
can be explained by this rule. 
We learned this is to be used in production and work.

Where 20 percent of your effort generate 80 percent of your results.
80 percent of our success comes from 20 percent of our actions.
More of what you want can used by 80/20 rule.

In the weekly meeting, we discussed some problems such as fastboot, audio, transfer
about Mango, WCIS and so on.
I can also understand some.

That's all. Thanks.
