Earthquakes are a common geological phenomenon, they may 
happen all over the world at any time.

We want to forecast the earthquake due to their devastating 
effects.
Even though earthquakes cannot be forecasted with 100 percent
certainty, there are still some strange things that we 
can do to help forecast earthquake.

We can look the behavior of animals such as dogs and cats,
they may change their behavior patterns prior to an earthquake.

If we can notice something different, maybe survived in the disaster.
That's all. Thanks.
