I tried to write a driver under sys directory 
of the kernel today.

The sys file system is a special file system,
similar to the proc file system but more complex than 
proc file system, which is used to organize
the equipment into a hierarchical structure and
provides kernel detailed information to the
user mode applications.

The proc file system is an memory file system that
allowed user access to kernel data structures that 
contained information, such as system and 
device status information.

I will study hard about sys file system.
That's all. Thanks.
