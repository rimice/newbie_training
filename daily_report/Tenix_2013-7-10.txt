The weather is still hot.
The sun shines brightly even when I go to work in the morning.

Today, I fixed the bug about the proc driver program wrote
in the yesterday.
Now ,it can be accessed under the proc directory by using command of
echo and cat.

I did a smoke test in the afternoon.
This is the version of Mango 3G which is different 
from the version of WIFI.
It has a SIM card.
So, we also increase a new SIM test.
That's all. Thanks.
