This was the third day I wrote the GPIO driver.
I still could not find the definition of Mango GPIO in the kernel.

There may be some differences from what I thought.
How does it describe in the kernel, and where is the address.
If there is no address, how to operate it ,which makes 
me confused.

These are all my problem now, I am trying to solve them.
In any case ,for my part I admit that there always have a way which
I haven't found yet.

I will keep working on it and never give up.
That's all. Thanks.
