I like swimming since I was a little kid.
My nephew decided to learn to swim this summer.	

I took him to the swimming center last weekend. 
I didn't expect there are so many people when I arrived.
Maybe in the summer, more and more people choose
natatorium to relieve the heat.

It is a good place, I feel very comfortable in the 
water, but also very cool.

After two days of rest, I start a new week.
I will go back into the work.
That's all. Thanks.
