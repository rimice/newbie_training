Yesterday,my elder sister told me that it would be three days of rain.

When I got home and went to work today ,the sky was cloudy. But it didn't affect my mood.

This morning ,Jerry and I went to get the OA computer in the tool room. Of course this also has a process of the company.

Under this process,we went to open the computer network in the information department.

Bruce help me cloned the training files on the github successfully at this time.

I began to be familiar with the new development about the ubuntu after that.

I learned how to upload the daily report to the github from Bruce and my director and  uploaded my first daily report successfully to the github before the end of the day. 

It is very interesting and amazing. Also it shows that the embedded industry's extensive and profound.

Refer to director said to me and jerry ,how much the requirements for an embedded determine your height in the future.

I will be strict to myself.

That's all.Thanks.
