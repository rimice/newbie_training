I went to work today with the cool wind. It was a good weather.
Today, we learned and tested KM web site.

I learned how to operate with the region of documents in the site.
How to publish articles and illustration. 
Search what you want by using title, keyword through function of document retrieval.
Join the forum to ask questions and participate in discussions.

This was my first time to use this site and it gave me a lot of surprise.
It's like a BBS to learn and communicate.

 All these communication really offer the opportunity for us to 
connect and understand each other.
It help us to find how much we have in common and share experiences.

I think the company do well in this respect.
That's all. Thanks.
