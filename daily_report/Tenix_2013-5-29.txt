When I went out today, and found that the weather bagan to hot.
Summer is coming.
We can't feel hot in the office, but it doesn't matter.

I met a problem today. I could not achieve the function of ioctl, which I had compiled
the code successful, but it can not work.
That was very strange.
I was thinking about this problem, almost whole day.
I gussed the problem of the header file. I checked the header file, wrote the code 
again but no use.

The problem was not chek out, until the time off the work.
I used now is the new linux kernel, the function of ioctl has changed, and I still used
the the previos parameter.

It was a long day, I feeled.
The linux kernel is always been improved and it include too many things.

Studying is like rowing a boat against the water, if you don't advance, you
will lag behind.

That's all. Thanks.
