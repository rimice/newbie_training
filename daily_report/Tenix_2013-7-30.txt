Last week, I heard a man in wheelchair, who set off a 
bomb in the Beijing airport over the weekend 
failed to end his life but succeeded in
getting authorities to reinvestigate his complaints.

This is shocking on me, take such extreme measure in
solving problem, but it is also helpless, maybe there
is no way to the bomber.

It is an irony of China's current system, ordinary people 
difficult to assert their interests.
That's all. Thanks.
