The two days National College Entrance Exam was finally over.
It is closely related to everyone's interests and performance of many high schools.

Nearly 9 million students  participated in the exam this year.

With the increasing growth of college student's quantity, it becomes increasing
difficult for the employment of college students.

Even though the economy in China has been developing rapidly, since the reform and
opening up.

I can only to say that the situation of employment becomes more and more serous.

It's Monday today.I think it's a new beginning to work hard, wish have a good time in
the following weekdays.

That's all. Thanks.
