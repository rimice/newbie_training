It is a new week. When I went out, it was a sunny day. 
Today, I did the smoke test ,again. It had added a new apk to test the reboot for 10 times , which was convenience . Because it was automatic test 10 times.

What the purpose of today's test is to confirm how much time does it takes.
I took the test in the afternoon, which cost two hours.
In the process of test, I found the HDMI could not transfer the sound to the monitor.
After the test, Allan taught me to catch the log which was produced in the mobile folder of tablet PC,
and I put it on the server.

In the morning, I modified the script which is used to set all of the preinstallation 
about the smoke test, in order to have a more specification management.
I added a version which is explained v1.0 of the script, changed the format of date.

I also replaced a new test video which is 1080p, now.
With the development of technological progress, the tablet PC is more and more powerful.

That's all. Thanks.
