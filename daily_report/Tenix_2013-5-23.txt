Today, the weather seemed to turn bad, when I went to work ,as if it was
going to rain in the morning.
Fortunately, all the way, it was no rain.

The first thing which I did, was to update the linux trainning code of ex01 to 
make it more standard. 
I add some comments about the author,setting time, modified time, 
description and so on.
The purpose is to facilitate the management in
the future, so it is very important. 

Director told me about this yesterday ,I also realized that was my mistake,
but I was doing a study plan.

I did not notice the time had passed so fast, when I realized ,
it had already been off work.
After that, I modified the code and uploaded it,but there were some mistakes,
I upload today.
It was ok.

what have I studied today ?
I tried to write the weekly programming and is almost ready.

That all. Thanks.
