I started to write a proc driver from yesterday.
I need to finish it in three days.
I have got a problem: the program could not use command of echo to write data to the proc device which can be 
created under proc directory automatically.

It always prompt that the address is error.
I am still considering the possible cause about this error.

Bruse told us something about repo in today's meeting.
He introduced some basic concepts, some analyses about parameter of repo and 
how to download repo guide script. 
It is just a script written by Google to help us download and manage andriod project repositories.
That's all. Thanks.
