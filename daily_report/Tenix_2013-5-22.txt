Yesterday, when I got home, I founded that my electric vehicles of right rearview mirror was be broken. I don't know how to cause it. Perhaps, the  electric vehicle was fell down when people rided away their vehicles.
I feeled very depressed ,this was my new electric vehicle to go to work.

Today, I learned the ppt in the linux driver folder, mainly learned the linux instructions which are some of the most basic such as mv, cp , du ,df and so on.
These instructions I had contact before, but this time I decided to learn it more stronger.
I realized them one by one at the terminal.

After that, I tried to write the weekly programming. 
When I wrote half of it, director said the study plan with me.
A good plan is a good start. 
Then, I got a template from bruce to write my plan. 

I looked at the plan carefully, planing the time, honping to be able to
complete within the given time which I scheduled.

I will work harder.
That all. Thanks.
