When I think tomorrow is the weekend, I will be excited.
Because,my sister invite me to her home play with my 
nephew this weekend.

I will take him to go swimming. He has begged me for a long time.
He has summer vocation now since two weeks ago.

It reminds me of the good days in my school, the joy,
the happiness,the sadness and the summer vocation.
That time has gone and will not come back no matter
how much I miss my past.
That's all. Thanks.
