I continued to learn the character devices of linux ,today.
I achieved the open, close, initialization, allocation of the device number, and loaded into the kernel about the linux drivers.

Of course ,it has some problems when I compiled the code.Some of the common grammatical
errors. 
I corrected them according the prompt of compiled. At last I successfully compiled it.
But,these functions are not complete. There are some function has not been added in it, including ioctl, udev mechanism. I will achieve them as soon as possible.

We had a meeting today,too. After the meeting, I asked Bruce for the ppt which discussed
in the meeting.
I don't understand the content in the ppt, because I am new to this.
I will consult to colleagues and understand it.

That's all. Thanks.
