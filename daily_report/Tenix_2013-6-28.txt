Well, another week has gone, I became familiar with in the office and suitable for the
work environment here.

Last week and this week, I talked part in the new employee training, which let 
me know more about the
company from the cultural to the production.

They have different styles, but what they  have in common were all very well.
Thanks to them. that's all. Thanks.
