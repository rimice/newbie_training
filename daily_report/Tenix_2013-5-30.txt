Today, I have studied the test about the tablet PC of the version of Mango LTE M06L on the platform of linux.

Allan taught me about these. There are at least ten items to test.
We firstly to test was the audio.  I recorded a voice which I knocked the table to play, because it has no song in the tablet PC. I played it perfectly.

Then, we tested the HDMI, we went to the front of the office, there is a monitor.
But, It could not display when we connected it.
After that, we detected the function of SD card to read and write.
It could not implement too.

In addition to this, the BT could not transfer files.
I tried another the same table PC to transfer files with my test one. 
It also could not transfer any file.

The following, I installed the apk to test g-sensor and gyro sensor.
It was ok.

We detected the WIFI, camera and brightness of LCM, too.
My director taught me to connect the WIFI through my mobile phone.
It was amazing.

That's all. Thanks.
