Today, I have studied the test about the tablet PC of the version of Mango LTE M06L on the platform of linux.

Allan teached me about these. There are at least ten items to test.
We firstly to test it the audio.  I recorded a voice which I knocked the table to play, because it has no song in the tablet PC. I plaied it perfectly.

Then, we test the HDMI, we went to the front of the office, there has a monitor.
But, It could not display when we connect it.
After that, we detected the function of SD card of reading and writing.
It could not achieve too.

In addition to this, the BT could not transmit data.
I tried another the same table PC to transmit data with my test one. 
It could not work too.

The following, I installed the apk to test gsensor and gyrosensor.
It was ok.

We detected the wifi, camera and brightness of LCM, too.
My charge teached me to connect the wifi through my mobile phone.
It was amazing.

That's all. Thanks.
