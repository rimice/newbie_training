I have heard a odd thing, recently.
One woman was be killed by an electric shock when making 
a phone call while it was recharging.

The phone was iphone5.
She bought the iphone5 at an official Apple store and
was using the original charger to recharger the phone by her 
sister said.

The sister also posted a message on the Sina Weibo following her death.
she said I hope that all of you will refrain from using your
iphone5 while recharging.

This message was reposted many times. It stirred a heated discussion
on the Internet about whether it was unsafe to use mobile phones 
while recharging.

I also feel very sorry about it.
That'all.
