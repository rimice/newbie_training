Today, we continued the class for new employees.

Wistron is an notebook manufacturer, with excellent testing equipment and perfect
production process of the manufacturing enterprise.

In today's class, I learned these processes.
It controls all aspects of processing from the receiving of raw materials to the shipment 
of the final product.

I modified the schedule of the Linux driver training, after class.
I put off a week to accomplish it. Hope everything goes well.

That's all.Thanks.
