It was still very hot today.
It suddenly get hot just few days before.

Today, I continued to study the GPIO driver.
Fortunately, I found the GPIO functions which were wrote by MTK in the kernel.

These functions seem to get or set the value of GPIO, even the direction 
of input or output.
But the strange thing is that I still can not find the address of GPIO
in the file I found.

I wonder where is the address. Perhaps it hides in the function or not.
I will keep analysing the function. 
That's all. Thanks.
