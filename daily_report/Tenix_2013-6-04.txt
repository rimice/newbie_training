I tried to write another char device which used "misc_register" to add a character
device to kernel, today.

It is a another technique about character device, and misc device come into common use in an embedded system. 
Misc device uses major number 10, which unlike regular character device whose major number can be allocated.
Actually misc register used major number 10 to call the register_chardev function. 

The advantage of misc device is that which can be create device file automatically,
without using mknod command to create a device file.
Because it can call the function such as class_device_creat and device_creat.
This function has posed a lot of convenience.
It also simplifies code considerably.

Meanwhile, disadvantage is also exposed. It only use  major number 10 to register.
But as a whole, I think the advantage is larger than the disadvantage.

That's all. Thanks.
