Earthquake is one of the most frightening and destructive phenomena of nature.

It is the sudden, rapid shaking of the earth, caused by the sudden breaking
and shifting of the rock under the crustal as it releases strain that has accumulated 
over a long time.

Its result can be very terrible.
I heard that a severe earthquake may release energy 10,000 times as great as
an atomic bomb.

The force of an earthquake maybe depend on how many rocks break and how far
they shift.
We assign a magnitude to earthquakes based on the strength.
3 to 5 is considered light, 5 to 7 is moderate, 7 to 8 is major
and 8 or more is great.
That's all. Thanks.
