In today's class, I learned the process of SMT.
The instructor is familiar with it and has the ability to solve the problem in the production.
I can feel his rich experience in class.

I have heard the SMT before, but I don't know what is it.
I had thought it just be one equipment, however it was a production line.

He described the technological process, the current situation of SMT, and 
emphasized all kind of SMT equipment such as SPP, HDP, SPI,
and its applications in Wistron company.

These devices are all expensive but quite efficient.
They reduce a lot of manpower and save the cost.

That's all. Thanks.
