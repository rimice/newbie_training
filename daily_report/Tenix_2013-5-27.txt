I was riding a bike to work today ,also can exercise my body. I ate more than usual at noon.
This new week, I decided to study hard at character device drivers of linux and learn more clearly.
It is one of the three most devices of linux drivers. The other two parts are block
device and network device.

The character device drivers of linux is also the most basic. These devices which has no buffer such as mouse, keyboard.

We can access the character devices as accessing a file.
It contains the system call such as open, close, read, write and so on.
This is very interesting.
These functions are concentrated in the struct of file_operation ,one by one with the corresponding about the applications of upper layer.
So, it is through the struct of file_operation to establish a connection.

The linux kernel is through the device number to distinguish the different devices.
It contains a main number and a minor number. 

The linux drivers which cover a range of knowledge and it is complicated.

That's all. Thanks.
